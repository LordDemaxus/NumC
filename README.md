### Provide answers to the following questions.
- How many hours did you spend on the following tasks?
  - Task 1 (Matrix functions in C):
3-4 hours
  - Task 2 (Speeding up matrix operations): 
5-6 hours
- Was this project interesting? What was the most interesting aspect about it?
  - <b>I thought this project was pretty interesting due to how it mixed older C concepts with the new optimization concepts we learned. I found using the SIMD instructions the most interesting.</b>
- What did you learn?
  - <b>I gained a better understanding of parellelism and SIMD instructions and how they can optimise matrix processes</b>
- Is there anything you would change?
  - <b>Not really much to change. Maybe more detail on transposing the matrix.</b>
